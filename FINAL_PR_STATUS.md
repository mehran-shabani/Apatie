## 🧪 Testing Checklist

Before merging, verify:

```bash
# 1. Build succeeds
make build

# 2. Services start properly
make up
docker compose ps  # All should be "Up" and healthy

## 🚀 Deployment Notes

### Development (Local)

Your `.env` file explicitly sets dev mode:
```env
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=config.settings.dev
```

Everything works as before - no breaking changes!

### Production (New Behavior)

Without setting `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`, it now defaults to prod:
```bash
python manage.py check  # Uses config.settings.prod
```

This is **safer** and prevents accidental dev mode in production.

- 🔐 Secure
- 🆕 Up-to-date  
- 🛡️ Production-safe
- 📚 Well-documented
- ✅ Ready to merge

**Recommendation**: Merge when ready! 🚀
